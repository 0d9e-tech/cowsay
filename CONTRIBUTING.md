# Contributing to cowsay

## Code of conduct

I have not selected a code of conduct yet, but please behave as though one were in place. Consider the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) and [Mac Homebrew's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct) to be examples.

## Contributions

Cowsay is a small project and is managed conservatively. Bug reports are welcome and will be acted on. Major unsolicited contributions are likely to be rejected.

### Bug reports

Bug reports, no matter how small, are welcome. Please submit them as Issues on [cowsay's GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay/issues).

Documentation and usability issues count as bugs.

### Pull requests

Please don't submit Pull Requests for features or nontrivial bug fixes without posting a request as an Issue first. Major new features that aren't on the project roadmap already probably won't be accepted. This project is an exercise in process and deployment, not functionality, so new features are not a priority.

If you would like to see a new feature in cowsay, whether you wish to work on it or not, please submit the feature request as an [issue](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay/issues) first. This will save wasted work on PRs that won't be accepted.

Pull requests for minor fixes (to code or documentation) are welcome.

## Upstream contributions

Please do *not* send any bug reports or pull requests to [the upstream project](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay). The original author has moved on and is not interested in maintaining cowsay any further.
